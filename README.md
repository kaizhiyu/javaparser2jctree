# javaparser2jctree
Java library that converts a Java Parser abstract syntax tree (AST) into an OpenJDK AST. The library is especially useful to parse a Java program and preserving the "per-node" comments, at the same time that one can still use Javac for type checking, code optimizations and code generation.

JavaParser2Jactre currently supports the following versions:
- Java Parser >= 1.8
- OpenJDK = 1.8
